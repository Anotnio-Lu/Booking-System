# Booking System

Welcome to my interactive MERN stack single-page application! As a full-stack web developer, I have built a booking system to help businesses monitor their drivers/employees while they are on the road, ensuring smooth appointments and reducing delays, miscommunication, and financial risks.

## User Story
As a business owner, I want a booking system to efficiently manage my drivers' schedules and appointments. This system should help reduce delays, miscommunication, and financial risks, ensuring a seamless experience for both my team and clients.

## Approach
To build this booking system, I started from scratch to showcase my front-end abilities using React and solidify my understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application. The project was completed collaboratively with a focus on data and user demand.

The application utilizes React for the front-end, providing an intuitive and user-focused platform. GraphQL, combined with Node.js and Express.js, serves as the server to efficiently handle data queries and mutations. MongoDB, along with the Mongoose ODM, ensures a scalable and reliable database for real-world data.

The user authentication is implemented using JWT, providing secure access to the application. Sensitive API key information on the server is protected to ensure data privacy.


## Completed tasks
To complete this project, I have accomplished the following tasks:

- Developed a booking system using React, GraphQL, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM.
- Implemented queries and mutations to manage driver schedules and appointments.
- Deployed the application using Heroku with real-world data.
- Created a polished, responsive, and interactive user interface.
- Implemented user authentication using JWT to ensure data security.
- Protected sensitive API key information on the server following best practices.
- Maintained a clean repository adhering to quality coding standards.
